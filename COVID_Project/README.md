# ðŸ’‰ COVID-19 Data Exploration 

Let's explore a global COVID-19 data set.

View the complete syntax [here](https://github.com/rb118/PortfolioProject/blob/main/COVID_Project/Covid_Portfolio_SQL_Final.sql)

***

### 1. Show total cases, total deaths, and the amount of deaths per case

``` sql
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths)/(total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE location = 'United States'
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

Result: 465 rows

Here are the last of the rows:

***

### 2. Show each location's highest amount of confirmed cases (max amount of people infected) and the percent of the popuation infected

``` sql 
SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

Result: 219 rows

Here are the first 9 rows:

***

### 3. Show countries and their max total death count

``` sql
SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC
```

Result: 210 rows

Here are the first 9 rows:

***

### 4. Show countries where highest death count is greater than or equal to 50,000

``` sql
with cte AS(
SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL 
GROUP BY location
)
SELECT location, TotalDeathCount
FROM cte
WHERE TotalDeathCount >= 50000
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC
```

Result: 210 rows

Here are the last rows (notice TotalDeathCount does not go below 50,000):

### 5. Show total cases, total tests, and the percent of confirmed cases of total tests

``` sql
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.total_cases, vac.total_tests, (dea.total_cases/vac.total_tests)*100 AS CasesPerTest
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths AS dea
JOIN PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations AS vac
	ON dea.location = vac.location
	AND dea.date = vac.date
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL AND dea.total_cases != 0 AND vac.total_tests != 0
ORDER BY location, date
```

Result: 38, 361 rows

Here are the first 9 rows:
