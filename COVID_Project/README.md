# ðŸ’‰ COVID-19 Data Exploration 

Let's explore a global COVID-19 [data set](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) (the data used for this project goes up to 4/30/21).

View the complete syntax [here](https://github.com/rb118/PortfolioProject/blob/main/COVID_Project/Covid_Portfolio_SQL_Final.sql).

View the Tableau visualizations [here](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/richard.b5125) (there is a dashboard with updated information as of 2023 visualizing global vaccinations).

***

### 1. What are the total cases, total deaths, and the amount of deaths per case in the United States?

``` sql
SELECT location, date, total_cases, total_deaths, (total_deaths)/(total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE location = 'United States'
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

Result: 465 rows

Here are the last few rows:

***

### 2. What are each location's highest amount of confirmed cases (max amount of people infected) and the percent of the popuation infected?

``` sql 
SELECT location, population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount, MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
GROUP BY location, population
ORDER BY 1, 2
```

Result: 219 rows

Here are the first 9 rows:

***

### 3. What is the max total death count for each location?

``` sql
SELECT location, MAX(CAST(total_deaths AS int)) AS TotalDeathCount
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE continent IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY location
ORDER BY TotalDeathCount DESC
```

Result: 210 rows

Here are the first 9 rows:

)

INSERT into #PercentPopulationVaccinated
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations,
SUM(CAST(vac.new_vaccinations AS int)) OVER(PARTITION BY dea.location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths AS dea
