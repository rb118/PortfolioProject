# üè† Nashville Housing Cleaning Project

In this project, we have a data set about housing in Nashville. Let's clean it to make it more usable for data analysis.

***

First, let's take a look at all of our data.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM PortfolioProject.dbo.NashvilleHousing
```

## 1. SaleDate Column

The SaleDate column is in DATETIME format. 

```sql
SELECT SaleDate
FROM PortfolioProject.dbo.NashvilleHousing
```

IMAGE: 

Let's change it so we only get the date (yyyy-mm-dd).

```sql
ALTER TABLE NashvilleHousing
Add SaleDateConverted Date;

UPDATE NashvilleHousing
SET SaleDateConverted = CONVERT(Date, SaleDate)
```

## 2. Populate Property Address Data

There are null values in the PropertyAddress column. Since this column is referring to the address of property, we can be almost certain that the values will not change. So, let's find out a way to fill these null values.

If we run the following query (where we order by ParcelID), we notice that there are multiple records where ParcelID and PropertyAddress is the same.

```sql
SELECT *
FROM PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
ORDER BY ParcelID
```

So, we can say if the first ParcelID highlighted has a PropertyAddress, and the second ParcelID does not have an PropertyAddress, let's populate it with the first address that's already populated since we know they are going to be the same.

We can do this by using a self join.

Let's run this query:

```sql
SELECT a.ParcelID, a.PropertyAddress, b.ParcelID, b.PropertyAddress, ISNULL(a.PropertyAddress, b.PropertyAddress)
FROM PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing a
JOIN PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing b
	ON a.ParcelID = b.ParcelID
	AND a.[UniqueID ] <> b.[UniqueID ]
WHERE a.PropertyAddress IS NULL
```
Result:

In this query, we use a self join. The first join condition is "WHEN a.ParcelID = b.ParcelID" because in the original data, there are multiple records with the same ParcelID. For the second join condition, we want the results to be when a.UniqueID IS NOT EQUAL to b.UniqueID. Since UniqueIDs are unique, this makes sure that the records we are querying will be different (in terms of UniqueID).

The next important part of this query is using the ISNULL function, which returns a specified value if the expression is NULL. For the above query, we are checking if a.PropertyAddress IS NULL. If it is NULL, then we want to return b.PropertyAddress.

This whole query creates a column that we will use to UPDATE the PropertyAddress column.

```sql
UPDATE a
SET PropertyAddress = ISNULL(a.PropertyAddress, b.PropertyAddress)
FROM PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing a
JOIN PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing b
	ON a.ParcelID = b.ParcelID
	AND a.[UniqueID ] <> b.[UniqueID ]
WHERE a.PropertyAddress IS NULL
```

The above UPDATE query will successfully populate the PropertyAddress column.

## 3. Separating Address into Individual Columns (Address, City, State)

Let's look at the PropertyAddress column.

```sql
SELECT PropertyAddress
FROM PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
```

IMAGE:

This column has the address followed by the city. Let's clean this data by separating the address from the city. 

Note that the data in this column is separated by a comma. We will use this to separate the column into two different ones. The following query will separate PropertyAddress into two columns: one for the address and the other for the city.

```sql
SELECT 
	SUBSTRING(PropertyAddress, 1, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) -1) AS Address,
	SUBSTRING(PropertyAddress, CHARINDEX(',', PropertyAddress) +2, LEN(PropertyAddress)) AS Address
FROM PortfolioProject..NashvilleHousing
```

IMAGE: 

To separate PropertyAddress into just the address, we used the SUBSTRING and CHARINDEX functions to get the data of each record BEFORE the comma. We used "-1" because we do not want the comma in the new column we are making.

To separate PropertyAddress into the city, we will use the same functions as before in addition to the LEN function. Firstly, our starting posititon (as per the syntax for the SUBSTRING function) is the index of the comma +2. The +2 will give us the start of the name of the city with no space or comma preceding it. We use LEN(PropertyAddress) as the last part of the SUBSTRING syntax to return the rest of the data in that record.
